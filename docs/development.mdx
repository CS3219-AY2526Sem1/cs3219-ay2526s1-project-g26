## Linting and Formatting

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for linting and code formatting, along with lint-staged and Husky for pre-commit checks.

Run Linters: You can run linting checks as defined in the GitHub workflow:

### For frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run format
```

### For Node.js services (e.g., userService)

```bash
cd services/userService
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run format
```

<Note>
Pre-commit Hook: The frontend and backend services (except aiService) uses a pre-commit hook to run npx lint-staged, which automatically lints and formats staged files.

</Note>

### For aiService (Python)

```bash
cd services/aiService
pip install black isort
isort --check-only --diff --profile black .
black --check --diff .
```
